# NoToasts

Disables those annoying warning toasts for everyone on the server.

## Chat Preview

The plugin will notify you if the chat preview warning is being sent.

## Secure Chat

Supports 1.19.1 clients on 1.19 servers with ViaVersion!

**There are side effects to disabling the warning.** You must ensure that all messages are either signed or system messages. Spigot and Paper currently do this by default.
